## Details

### Problem Statement 1

- ### PayMoney
  > Given a list of transactions done by PayMoney and a daily target, your task is to determine at which transaction PayMoney achieves the same.

- ### Currency Denomination
  > Given the currency denomination in random order. You have to make a payment of amount x, in such a way that the number of notes you give is minimum.




### Solution Details

- ### PayMoney
  > - In PayMoney the operation to determine at which transaction PayMoney achieves the target can be performed on 'Unsorted Array' to get the output as in the test case or it can be performed on 'Sorted Array' to reach the target early
  > - I have MergeSort for sorting the array in descending order 
  > - Default output is for the unsorted array. To get the output for the sorted array, uncomment the marked portions in the code  

- ### Currency Denomination
  > - In Currency Denomination for descending sorting I have used BubbleSort implementation and QuickSort implementation 
  > - To view the final result I have used Map Implementation and Array Implementation 
  > - Default sorting is done using QuickSort. To get the output for sorted array using BubbleSort, uncomment the marked portions in the code 
  > - Default output generation is done using Array. To get the output using Map, uncomment the marked portions in the code 

Both the solution contains a Driver class which contains the `main()` method to run the program.
